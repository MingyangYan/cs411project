This is user story 3. 

The user has just watched a tutorial on the CapThat upload photo page and are eager to create a caption for a photo of themselves and their dog. Rather than pasting a link, they decide to upload their photo, and they tag their location as Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. CapThat's API integration of 'Clarifai' recognizes ten words that exist in the image: such as female, dog, backyard, sun, grass, San Francisco, Golden Gate, beer, fun, water. The user is able to tick up to five words that they want to be apart of their caption generation process. 
From there, the user can choose the sentiment of their caption, e.g. positive or negative. CapThat generates a random caption that is based on song lyrics and the words in the image. If they are dissatisfied with the caption, they can click on the button "generate a new caption". If they are satisfied, they can post their photo and caption to their profile page, which will also be featured on the newsfeed.
