News feed

1) As a signed-in user, his/her homepage will have news feeds from other signed-up users in order to get inspirations. The feeds are pictures uploaded by other users along with captions generated by our program. It is like instagram, but put more focus on the caption instead of the picture. In other words, we will make the captions more obvious than the pictures. As a signed-in user, he/she can see the profile picture and username of whom the news feed belongs to, and go to other users' profile page by clicking on their profile picture/username. A signed-in user also has a collection of pastly uploaded pictures in his profile page. 

2) As a guest user, he/she cannot see any news feeds. A guest user can only upload pictures and get a captions generated for the pictures. A guest user does not have a collection of past uploaded pictures either.
