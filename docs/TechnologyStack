Technology Stack 

We are choosing to use a MEAN Stack as it is all encompassing. 

MongoDB will serve as the backend for our project, and since it is non-relational its ideal for our project. 

Express will help us to manage our routes, handling requests and views. 

Angular will helps us to manage the front-end easily as it uses uses HTML to define the apps interface and the data models are Javascript objects. 

Node.JS will help us manage the JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side and produce dynamic web content before the page is sent to the web browser.
