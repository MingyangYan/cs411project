Technology Stack 

We are choosing to use a MEAN Stack for its simplicity, common structure. It is also open-sourced so we will pay no fees.

MongoDB will serve as the backend for our project for its flexibitity being a non-relational database.

Express will help us to manage our routes, handling requests and views. 

Angular will helps us to manage the front-end easily as it uses uses HTML to define the apps interface and the data models are Javascript objects. 

Node.JS will help us manage the JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side and produce dynamic web content before the page is sent to the web browser. NodeJS is lightweight and efficient, ideal for data-intensive real-time applications.
